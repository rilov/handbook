  <p><strong>Part 1 of the Meta Data Lineage Series</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This article is based on my understanding after reading the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2025/01/22/security/how-meta-discovers-data-flows-via-lineage-at-scale/">Meta Engineering blog post</a> and several related articles. I’m trying to demystify and explain these concepts in an accessible way. If you want to understand exactly what Meta built, please refer to the original article linked in the Further Reading section.</p>

  <p><strong>The surprising problem:</strong> Meta has billions of users and world-class infrastructure. But when someone enters their religion on Facebook Dating, can they guarantee it won’t be used elsewhere? The answer required building something unprecedented.</p>

  <p><strong>This article</strong> explains why data lineage became critical for privacy at Meta’s scale — and why manual tracking completely breaks down.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-a-simple-privacy-promise">Introduction: A Simple Privacy Promise</h2>

<p>Imagine you’re building a dating profile on Facebook Dating and you enter your religion:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User fills out profile:
Religion: "Buddhist"

User's expectation:
✅ Used to match with compatible partners
❌ NOT used to show religious ads on Instagram
❌ NOT used to personalize Facebook News Feed
❌ NOT used for anything else

Question: Can Facebook guarantee this?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>For a small app:</strong> This is easy. You know where all your data goes.</p>

<p><strong>For Meta (billions of users, millions of code assets):</strong> This is one of the hardest technical challenges imaginable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Think of it like this:</strong> Imagine a city with millions of water pipes, and you need to guarantee that water from one specific faucet never reaches certain buildings. Now imagine the pipes are constantly being rebuilt while water is flowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the story of how Meta built <strong>data lineage</strong> — the technology that traces data as it flows through their massive systems — to enable <strong>Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI)</strong> at unprecedented scale.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-privacy-aware-infrastructure-pai">What is Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI)?</h2>

<h3 id="the-simple-explanation">The Simple Explanation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI)</strong> is Meta’s suite of technologies that enforce privacy rules automatically in code, rather than relying on humans to follow guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The core principle:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Old approach (doesn't scale):
Write policies → Train developers → Hope they follow rules → Audit manually

PAI approach (scales):
Write policies → Embed in infrastructure → Impossible to violate → Automatic verification
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="why-pai-is-needed">Why PAI is Needed</h3>

<p><strong>The regulatory landscape:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2018: GDPR in Europe
- Requires "purpose limitation"
- Data can only be used for stated purposes
- Violations: Up to 4% of global revenue ($4.6B+ for Meta)

2020: CCPA in California
- Similar requirements
- Growing globally

2023: 100+ privacy laws worldwide
- Each with different requirements
- Manual compliance: impossible at scale
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The scale problem:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Meta's challenge:
├─ 3.8 billion users
├─ 100+ products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.)
├─ Millions of data assets (tables, APIs, models)
├─ Billions of lines of code
├─ Thousands of engineers
└─ Code changes: 1,000+ per day

Manual privacy tracking:
❌ Impossible
❌ Error-prone
❌ Doesn't scale
❌ Can't verify
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="example-purpose-limitation">Example: Purpose Limitation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Purpose limitation</strong> restricts the purposes for which data can be processed and used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User enters religion on Dating app

Allowed uses (explicit consent):
✅ Match with compatible partners
✅ Show to potential matches
✅ Dating recommendations

NOT allowed (no consent):
❌ Personalize News Feed
❌ Target ads
❌ Train general AI models
❌ Share with other products

Challenge: How do you enforce this across billions of lines of code?

<h3 id="what-is-data-lineage">What is Data Lineage?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Data lineage</strong> traces the journey of data as it moves through systems, from source to sink.</p>

<p><strong>The PAI workflow:</strong></p>

  <li><strong>Control placement</strong>: “Where should we add privacy controls?”</li>
  <li><strong>Verification</strong>: “Are our controls actually working?”</li>

<h3 id="metas-data-landscape">Meta’s Data Landscape</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Assets to track:
├─ Web endpoints: 100,000+
├─ Database tables: 1,000,000+
├─ Data warehouse tables: 10,000,000+
├─ AI models: 100,000+
├─ Logging systems: 10,000+
└─ Microservices: 50,000+

Technology stacks:
├─ Languages: Hack, C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Java

├─ Processing: Web servers, batch jobs, streaming pipelines
└─ ML platforms: PyTorch, TensorFlow, custom frameworks

Code changes:
├─ 1,000+ commits per day
├─ 5,000+ engineers making changes
├─ Assets constantly being created/modified/deleted
└─ No way to manually track
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-problem-manual-tracking-doesnt-scale">The Problem: Manual Tracking Doesn’t Scale</h3>

<p><strong>Traditional approach (what most companies do):</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Manual data lineage:
├─ Engineers document data flows
├─ Create diagrams in slides/wikis
├─ Update spreadsheets
└─ Hope it stays accurate

Reality:
❌ Documentation immediately out of date
❌ Engineers forget to update
❌ Takes weeks to trace one data flow
❌ Incomplete (only ~10% coverage)
❌ Can't verify accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Example: Tracing religion data manually</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Week 1: Start investigation
- Interview Dating team: "Where do you send religion data?"
- Dating team: "Uh... to the database, some logs, maybe some APIs?"
- Manually read code to find all references

Week 2: Trace database
- Find 47 downstream tables that read from dating_profiles
- Each has 20-100 downstream consumers
- Need to check each one

Week 3: Trace APIs
- Find 15 APIs that expose profile data
- Who calls these APIs? Need to search all code
- Each API has 50+ callers

Week 4: Trace logs
- Religion might be in 200+ log tables
- Each log feeds into data warehouse
- Data warehouse has 1,000s of downstream tables

Week 8: Still not done
- Found 10,000+ potential data flows
- 90% are false positives
- Still missing actual flows
- Code has changed since week 1 (already out of date!)

Result: 
- 2 months spent
- Incomplete and inaccurate
- Out of date immediately
- Costs $50,000+ per investigation
- Impossible to scale
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="why-manual-tracking-fails">Why Manual Tracking Fails</h3>

<p><strong>Problem 1: Dynamic systems</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>While you're documenting:
├─ New tables are created
├─ New code is deployed
├─ New data flows are added
└─ Documentation is already wrong

It's like mapping a city where streets
change every minute!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Problem 2: Transformed data</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input: religion = "Buddhist"

Transformation 1:
religion → {metadata: {religion: "Buddhist"}}

Transformation 2:
{religions: ["Buddhist", "Hindu"]} → {count: 2}

Transformation 3:
"Buddhist" → "B" (code)

Question: Are these the same data?
Manual tracking: Impossible to tell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Problem 3: Indirect flows</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Direct flow (easy to track):
dating_profile.religion → recommendation_engine

Indirect flow (nearly impossible to track):
dating_profile.religion 
  → tmp_table_abc123
  → aggregated_features
  → model_training_dataset
  → recommendation_model
  → inference_service
  → another_product

Manual tracking: Would take months to discover this chain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Problem 4: Scale</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>To manually track religion data:
├─ Review: 1,000,000+ lines of code
├─ Interview: 500+ engineers
├─ Check: 100,000+ assets
├─ Trace: 1,000,000+ potential flows
└─ Time: 6-12 months (minimum)

But:
├─ Code changes daily
├─ Engineers leave/join
├─ Systems evolve
└─ Impossible to keep up

Cost: $5M+ per privacy requirement
Timeline: Months to years
Accuracy: 50-60% at best

<p><strong>The challenge:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GDPR requirement: Religion data must be purpose-limited

To implement:
1. Find all places religion is used
2. Add privacy controls at those places
3. Verify controls work

Without lineage:
❌ Can't find all places (manual search takes months)
❌ Miss hidden flows (transformed data)
❌ Can't verify (no visibility)

Result: Can't comply with GDPR
Risk: $4.6B fine (4% of global revenue)

    profile = get_dating_profile(user_id)
    # Use ALL profile data for recommendations
    return train_model(profile)

Oops: Just used religion data for non-dating purposes!

Without lineage:
- Nobody knows religion data leaked
- No alerts

- Privacy violation goes undetected

With lineage:

<h3 id="consequence-3-slow-product-development">Consequence 3: Slow Product Development</h3>

<p><strong>The bottleneck:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Product team: "We want to add a new feature"

Manual review:
- Week 1-4: Document current data flows
- Week 5-8: Trace new data flows
- Week 9-12: Write privacy review
- Week 13-16: Get approvals
- Week 17-20: Implement controls

Total: 5 months before feature can launch

Result:
